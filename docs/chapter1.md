Statistical tests use a data sample to assess and make an inference about a population from which the sample is drawn. In a two-sample comparison, the goal often is to assess whether the means of some attribute obtained for individuals in the two samples (sub-populations) differ. Statistical power (simply power) is the probability of detection of an effect quantified by a size called effect size, in other words the probability that the test will find a statistically significant difference between that attribute in the samples. When there exists an actual effect, the power of a test represents the chances of effect detection.

# Power

Power depends on a number of factors for effect detection, few of which pertain to a specific testing situation. The ones power almost always depends on are significance level used in the test, magnitude of the effect-of-interest (effect of size), and size of the sample. Power versus sample size yields the power curve which tells us how adequate the size is to detect a significant effect in a test (experiment) or randomized controlled trial (RCT).

The power of a test is the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null is false. So it is the true positive rate (TPR). Power value ranges from 0 to 1. As the power increases, false alarms (false positives) reduce wherein FP is the probability to (incorrectly) reject the null when it is true.
