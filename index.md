# Introduction

We fit a supervised machine learning model to classify data by performing regression. The target in the dataset is typically binary, meaning the class labels are 1/0 or YES/NO and the outcome of regression is probability values. The probabilities are converted into the class labels based on the classification or probability threshold p = 0.5 for a balanced dataset. The probability values also need posthoc calibration.
